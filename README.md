# pico-ctf

put code here if you want to do a thing.

If you want to add code use a "pull request".

To add like a folder rather than flattened files you have to do it from the command prompt:

    cd /path/to/files
    git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Innoviox/pico-ctf
    git add .
    git commit "message"
    git push -uf origin master
